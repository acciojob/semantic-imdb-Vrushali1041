			Tumhara result decide nahi karta hai ki tum loser ho ki nahi… Tumhari koshish decide karti hai!

			Doosron se haarke loser kehlane se kahin zyada bura hai…khud se haarke loser kehlana.

            I am a failure mera kuchh nhi ho sakta… But we forgot success doesnt come at once

			Pata nahi kya jaadu hai college life mein…Jahan anjaane milte hai aur dost ban jaate hai…
			Zindagi bhar ke liye… aur aise waise dost nahi…kutte dost.
